**Subject:**

Write a program that takes two strings and displays, without doubles, the characters that appear in both strings, in the order they appear in the first one.

The display will be followed by a newline character.

If the number of arguments is not 2, the program displays a newline character.

**Code Explanation:**

The code provided solves the given problem by iterating over the characters of the first string (`av[1]`). It checks each character to ensure it is not a duplicate by calling the `duplicate` function. If the character is not a duplicate and it is found in the second string (`av[2]`), it is written to the standard output using the `write` function.

Here's a breakdown of the important parts of the code:

1. The `duplicate` function checks if a character `c` exists in the string `str` up to index `n`. It iterates over the string and compares each character with `c`. If a match is found, it returns 1, indicating that the character is a duplicate. Otherwise, it returns 0.

2. The `ft_strchr` function searches for the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `str`. It iterates over the string and compares each character with `c`. If a match is found, it returns a pointer to the character in `str`. If no match is found, it returns NULL.

3. In the `main` function, the code first checks if the number of command-line arguments (`ac`) is equal to 3. If it is, the code proceeds with the character comparison.

4. The code uses a loop to iterate over each character of the first string (`av[1]`). For each character, it checks if it is a duplicate (using `duplicate` function) and if it exists in the second string (`av[2]`) (using `ft_strchr` function). If both conditions are true, the character is written to the standard output using the `write` function.

5. Finally, the code writes a newline character to the standard output using the `write` function.


The code utilizes the `write` function from the `unistd.h` library to output characters. The `write` function takes the file descriptor, the buffer to write from, and the number of bytes to write.

```

The diagram illustrates the control flow of the program. It starts by checking if the number of command-line arguments (`ac`) is equal to 3. If it is, the program proceeds to iterate over the characters of the first string. For each character, it checks if it is a duplicate and if it exists in the second string. If both conditions are true, the character is written to the standard output. After processing all characters, a newline character is written to the standard output.
