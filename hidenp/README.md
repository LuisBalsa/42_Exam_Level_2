## Code Explanation

The given code is an implementation of the `hidenp` program. It takes two strings as command-line arguments and determines whether the first string is hidden in the second string.

The code follows the following steps:

1. It first checks if the number of command-line arguments is equal to 3. If not, it simply returns a newline and terminates.
2. If the number of arguments is valid, it initializes two variables `i` and `k` to 0. These variables will be used to traverse the characters in the strings.
3. It enters a while loop that iterates over each character of the second string (`argv[2]`).
4. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character of the second string matches the character in the first string (`argv[1]`) at index `k`. If there's a match, it increments `k`.
5. After checking the match, it verifies if all the characters of the first string have been found in order. If yes, it writes "1" to the standard output and breaks out of the loop.
6. If the loop completes without finding all the characters, it checks if there are remaining characters in the first string. If yes, it means the first string is not hidden, and it writes "0" to the standard output.
7. Finally, it writes a newline character to the standard output and returns 0.

## Flowchart

1. Start
2. Check if the number of command-line arguments is 3
   - No: Print newline and exit
   - Yes:
     - Initialize variables `i` and `k` to 0
     - Start a while loop over each character in the second string
     - Check if the current character matches the character in the first string at index `k`
       - Yes: Increment `k`
       - No:
         - Check if all characters in the first string have been found in order
           - Yes: Print "1" and exit
           - No: Print "0" and exit
3. Print newline
4. End
